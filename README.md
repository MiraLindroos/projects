# Welcome to look at some of my projects!

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Business Information Systems at TAMK. Below are some of the projects I've worked on during my courses:

_**Tic Tac Toe (Java)**_

ABOUT THE PROJECT: Developed a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where users can set the playfield size and win conditions. The game allows users to play against the computer.

TO COMPILE AND RUN: To run the game, navigate to the 'src' directory, compile using javac TicTacToe.java, then execute with java TicTacToe.

HOW TO USE: Do the above commands in cmd and then just answer the questions asked in the game!
