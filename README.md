# Welcome to look at some of my projects!

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Business Information Systems at TAMK. Below are some of the projects I've worked on during my courses:

## _Tic Tac Toe (Java)_

ABOUT THE PROJECT: Developed a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where users can set the playfield size and win conditions. The game allows users to play against the computer.

TO COMPILE AND RUN: To run the game, navigate to the 'src' directory, compile using javac TicTacToe.java, then execute with java TicTacToe.

HOW TO USE: Do the above commands in cmd and then just answer the questions asked in the game!

## _Hangman (Python)_

HOW TO USE Do the above commands in cmd and then just answer the questions asked in the game!

## _React projects_

This project, a ToDo page, was my initial exposure to React. It helped me understand the basics of component-based web development and how to manage state in React applications. https://github.com/MiraLindroos/reactproject

This project might seem small and simple, but it was a step for me towards React Native and making mobile apps. It showed me how to build things for phones using JavaScript. https://github.com/MiraLindroos/react-native-app
