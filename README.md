# Welcome to look at some of my projects!

I study Business Information Systems at TAMK.
These projects are done for courses.

During our third year of school, I was a part of a team who made a grief support website for people who have experienced a tramautic loss of child.
Here is the link to the website: https://griefsupport.fi

During our first year of school, we made a mobile game and a website for the game.
