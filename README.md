# Welcome to look at some of my projects!

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Business Information Systems at TAMK. Below are some of the projects I've worked on during my courses:

## _Tic Tac Toe (Java)_

ABOUT THE PROJECT: Developed a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where users can set the playfield size and win conditions. The game allows users to play against the computer.

TO COMPILE AND RUN: To run the game, navigate to the 'src' directory, compile using javac TicTacToe.java, then execute with java TicTacToe.

HOW TO USE: Do the above commands in cmd and then just answer the questions asked in the game!

## _Hangman (Python)_

ABOUT THE PROJECT: Created a Hangman game in Python, allowing users to guess words randomly chosen from a text file. The game determines a win or loss based on the user's guesses.

TO COMPILE AND RUN: Run cd hangman and execute python3 hangman.py in the command line to start the game.

HOW TO USE Do the above commands in cmd and then just answer the questions asked in the game!

## _React projects_

A small ToDo page was my initial exposure to React. It helped me understand the basics of component-based web development and how to manage state in React applications.

A simple React Native app that lists users and their images was created as part of an assignment. Although it was small and simple, it was a step for me towards React Native and making mobile apps. Through this project, I learned how to build mobile applications using JavaScript, showcasing my skills in the framework and serving as an effective introduction to the world of mobile development. This experience ultimately led to an internship where I was able to deepen my knowledge further.


## _Expense tracker REST API_

Expense tracker was developed as part of a backend course, aiming to create a RESTful API for managing expenses using Node, Express, and MySQL.

## _Websites_

The project involved custom CSS, responsive design enhancements, and theme customizations to align the website’s look and feel with the brand’s identity. https://verso-opetushoitola.fi

**Grief Support Website:** Contributed to the development of a grief support website for those who've experienced traumatic loss of child. https://griefsupport.fi
